        <p>I am talking about Gaming. My favorite hobby is playing video games. Yes, you might be thinking “How does gaming reduce your stress levels”. I’ll explain how. You see in a world full of competitiveness, I have found my passion and named it my hobby. Playing video games helps me to release my stress, also it relaxes me from a hard and long day of school/work. No, I am talking about the games that actually help you to understand this hard world a lot better. I am talking about competitive gaming. People from all over the world, gamers gathering around in an area, being shouted on, and cheered by a few millions of gamers, what’s better than that? Competitive gaming not only helps in actually competing but also develops a sense of “Being the best” in one. I would almost spend 1/2/3 hr playing video games each day.

            Gaming is my way to relax. So, what’s better than finding your hobby is something that accelerates your desire for being the best through something that almost 50% of my readers like doing “Gaming”. <br><br> Videogames are played for the sake of entertainment. Adopting a hobby not only helps you in confirming who you are a person but who you are as a happy person who can take on any challenges and still stay stress-free because what he adapted as his hobby helps him in being that person. There are both positive and negative effects on playing these games. Most negative effects are endured by excessive playing. Your reflexes might improve if you play games that need timing. You learn English while you play because games are usually in English. Gaming can be addictive! The cons of gaming are not that bad, it depends on how much you play and from what point you look at it.
